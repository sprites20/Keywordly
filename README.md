# Keywordly
Keywordly is a web application that was created to help reduce joblessness in the Philippines, this project introduces a smart and adaptable system that effectively links job opportunities with individuals seeking work. By integrating AI with diverse algorithms, it delivers speedy, accurate, and tailored job recommendations.

# Run the code in CodeSandbox.io

Running the demo so no installation would be needed.

# RUNNING STEPS
For compiling the React app it needs npm or Vite which can take a while to download so we are creating a separate repository for the compiled/built version.
You can clone this repository and extract, then open the build folder and run index.html to open the website.

But for cloning just download this repository, extract it then open CMD after installing npm:
You can install npm with the Node.js package by following the instructions here. Or by installing with the installer.
[Node.js + NPM installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After installing, open cmd, do `cd <path where src is>`
Then:
Install the packages
`npm install`

Start the web application
`npm start`

The backend has to be running for the website's functionality to work else it will just be a page with buttons not working.

# Running the Backend
Requires Python 3.x which can be downloaded here.
[Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install Python with pip and then run in cmd.
`cd <path to backend folder>`

Install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create Database (Optional):

`python createduck.py`

Run the server

`python somehashing.py`



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This installs all needed packages in the package.json required before running npm start to minimize errors.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
